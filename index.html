              <p>
                The lack of practical experiences, insufficient resources, and
                focusing upon memorization instead of understanding are common
                issues in the current education system. In most of the schools,
                the teacher is not able to provide a practical demonstration of
                concepts due to unavailability of resources. Students interested
                in a particular topic are not able to get enough resources and
                information from the schools/teachers so that they could grow
                and become better in the skills they are interested in.
                Nowadays, there is more emphasis on rote memorisation and an
                unhealthy environment is created in schools where students study
                only to get more marks.

                    <li>
                      Lack of Conceptual Learning and Visualization: <br />
                      Students are not made to visualize or imagine what they
                      are being taught and they may struggle to understand
                      complex concepts explained in class.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Non-Interactive Environment in Class: <br />
                      Due to communication and a skillset barrier between
                      students and teachers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Less Innovation and Support: <br />
                      Both teachers and students need more resources for a
                      proper explanation of concepts and for exploring their
                      interests respectively.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Less Exposure: <br />
                      Students are given very low to zero opportunities by the
                      schools to interact with their environment and the society
                      around them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Lack Of Efficiency: <br />Students' time and energy
                      expenditure does not give appropriate results and they
                      have to provide extra time for tuition, coaching, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      No Profile for Students in their Community: <br />There is
                      no way a student can know where he stands or what his
                      skill status is among the students of his same age group.

                    <li>
                      Lack of Objects and Models for Teaching: <br />
                      Only theory-based teaching is done in classes, no
                      physical/practical models are made available to the
                      teachers.
                    </li>
                    <li>Lack of Equipment and Setups for Experimentation</li>
                    <li>
                      Lack of Time for designing well-planned Creative Class:
                      <br />
                      The teachers are restricted by time-constraint from
                      completing their own syllabi.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Lack of Resources (Customizable and Non-Customizable)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Lack of Support(Independent Support): <br />There is no
                      service available to the teachers to provide unbound
                      support to them, assisting them in teaching in a more
                      innovative and creative manner.

                    <li>
                      No Profile for teachers in the community: <br />The
                      teachers are unable to know their status or where they
                      stand on the basis of their skills in their particular

                    <li>
                      Improper Tech Upgradation: <br />
                      Many schools are still dependent upon 2-D learning or
                      chalk-blackboard learning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      No track of Class Structure: <br />Syllabus and curriculum
                      in schools are many times lagging behind because of no
                      real-time track of concepts and topics covered on a
                      regular basis in classes.

                    <li>
                      No awareness of the School's overall profile in their
                      Town/City/State:
                      <br />
                      There is no such system that provides a ranking of schools
                      on the basis of various academic and non-academic
                      parameters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Lack of Network: <br />Schools are not having any kind of
                      interaction and communication with each other, making them
                      isolated in their own Towns/Cities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Load of academic work which makes conducting non-academic
                      activities less frequent
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Restricted Management: <br />Schools have to manage their
                      own academic tasks and conduct various activities within
                      the premises, which makes organizing and participation in
                      inter-school activities difficult.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Lack of Cross-Platform Learning: <br />There is no flow of
                      knowledge from one school to another due to no room for
                      interaction between teachers from different schools.

                      No direct reach to the teachers and students: <br />
                      The point of contact is the school itself and there is no
                      such system of communication for the students and the
                      teachers.

                    <li>
                      No proper tracing and data analysis of the students and
                      teachers: <br />
                      The boards as well as the government are unable to track
                      down the talents or the skill levels of the
                      students/teachers of a particular town/city/state because
                      of the lack of a system for such analysis.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Untraceable data for different pools (skills, subjective,
                      etc.): <br />
                      It is hard to know if the students or teachers in a
                      particular area /region are better than those in some
                      other area or region because there is no reliable method
                      to measure and compare the skill levels.

                  The Skiome app is basically made to implement all of its
                  functionalities and services to the schools. It provides
                  various facilities to the schools:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      It provides an interface where teachers can purchase any
                      object, model, or experiment required for their
                      subject/topic in the vicinity of their homes through the
                      application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The teachers are also free to request any
                      modifications/changes in the objects or the models they
                      receive, providing them with an independent and
                      personalized teaching experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The app contains all the models and objects for the entire
                      senior and Senior-secondary classes. This data is divided
                      into Categories which are a subjectwise division of the
                      classes. Each category contains kits relating to all the
                      concepts covered in that particular subject in that
                      particular class. Each kit contains all the objects and
                      setups, information related to them, the concepts covered,
                      and a step-by-step guide on how to use them (along with a
                      video demonstration).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      It displays updates about the upcoming and ongoing events
                      and workshops being organized by Skiome in the nearby
                      regions of the school.

                    <li>
                      The app gives updates about the upcoming inter-school or
                      inter-state competitions being held and further details
                      about participating in them.

                    <li>
                      The app contains a profile about the schools and teachers

                    <li>

                  Skiome Centre is a physically well-maintained and
                  well-developed store that acts as a capital for all the
                  offline and on-ground operations and services provided by
                  Skiome. It stores all the objects, models, and experiments
                  which are included within the Skiome application. <br />
                  <br />
                  All the tech support and resource distribution demanded by the
                  teachers, and customisation in the objects and models are done
                  here within the centres. It works as a connecting point for
                  all the schools fetching all their demands and providing
                  Skiome features. Skiome centre will be having a centre in
                  charge who will be responsible for all the functioning.
                  Schools and teachers are free to contact the centre in charge
                  for any query or help. Verified teachers and school
                  authorities along with students will be allowed to visit the
                  centre as and when specified or scheduled by the centre in
                  charge. This also follows for the common public but there will
                  be a restriction for them to get into the centre.
